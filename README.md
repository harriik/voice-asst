
# Hello and Welcome to my GitHub repository

    I have uploaded this mini project which I have done during my Sophomore year in my college. We have named this project as project "JARVIS". We as a team of two, have developed a Personal Voice Assistant as a java desktop application using java swings as frontend and MySQL database as backend which uses sphinx library for speech recognition.
